# candle-distributed

## Introduction

This is a distributed deep learning framework based on [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle)

## TODO

- distributed dataset, dataloader and sampler like torch
- parameter server
- ring all-reduce

## ROADMAP
This project is still on very early stage. Since I was major in Computer Vision, my plan is to implement a multi gpu training example of Object Detection model like YOLO series.
