# candle-distributed

## Introduction

This is a distributed deep learning framework based on [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle)

## TODO

- [x] multi worker detail: prefetch
- [x] test of multi worker dataloader. use this dataloder to train a model
- distributed dataset, dataloader and sampler like torch
- [] things related to GPU
- [] parameter server
- [] ring all-reduce


## ROADMAP
This project is still on very early stage. Since I was major in Computer Vision, my plan is to implement a multi gpu training example of Object Detection model like YOLO series.
